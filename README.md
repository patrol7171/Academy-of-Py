<p>The scenario depicted here for this analysis is how a data analyst helps a school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.</p>
<p>The data to be analyzed are district-wide standardized test results which includes every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The data must be aggregated in order to showcase obvious trends in school performance.</p> 
The steps for deriving a final report include each of the following:

#### PART 1: Data Clean-up & Prep
#### PART 2: District Summary
#### PART 3: School Summary
#### PART 4: Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
#### PART 5: Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
#### PART 6: Math Scores by Grade
#### PART 7: Reading Scores by Grade
#### PART 8: Scores by School Spending
#### PART 9: Scores by School Size
#### PART 10: Scores by School Type

### <font color=maroon>*Observed Trends:* 

* Schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student (\$645-675) actually under-performed compared to schools with smaller budgets (<\$585 per student).
* Smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).
* Charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
